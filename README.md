**This mod is an unofficial addition for VE.** This mod doesn't require Vanilla Outposts Expanded to work, but it highly recommended to use it, since VOE: Additional Outposts was intended as addition to it.

Versions before Rimworld 1.3 wasn't tested, but might work.

Supported languages: English, Russian.

## Add/Remove

VOE: Additional Outposts mod should be safe to add to existing save. But when you want to remove it, better make backup save just in case.
